# Deploying from a client-side web app to Cloud Run

This repository contains examples of how to deploy to [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) purely from client-side web applications. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to allow users to deploy applications without needing to set up a backend server.

## Examples

* **[Hello, World!](hello/)**: Deploy a simple "Hello, World!" container.
* **[Deploying Gemma on Cloud Run](gemma/)**: Deploy a Gemma model on Cloud Run with GPU support.
* **[Deploy from Source](from-source/)**: Deploy an application from source code.
